# DCGAN Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed to generate realistic data by training two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—in an adversarial setup. Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) are an extension that uses convolutional layers for better performance and more realistic image generation.

### Features
- Implementation of the DCGAN architecture.
- Training on image datasets to generate realistic images.
- Customizable parameters for generator and discriminator networks.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the `.ipynb` file)

### Training
- The notebook allows customization of the following parameters:
  - Learning rate
  - Batch size
  - Number of epochs
  - Latent space dimension
- Ensure you have a dataset of images for training (e.g., CIFAR-10, CelebA). The notebook includes steps for loading and preprocessing the dataset.

### Output
- The trained generator will create images based on the latent space input.
- Images generated during training will be saved to the output folder (configurable in the notebook).

## Results

After training, the model generates realistic images based on the input dataset. Generated images will be saved and displayed in the notebook.
